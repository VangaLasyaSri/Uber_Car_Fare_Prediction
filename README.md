# Uber Car Fare Prediction ðŸš–

Welcome to the Uber Car Fare Prediction repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains the code and resources for predicting Uber ride fares using machine learning algorithms. The project was developed during my AI & ML internship and demonstrates the application of various data science techniques to a real-world problem.

## Repository Structure

All components of the project are organized as follows:

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
  - `cab_rides.csv`: The main dataset used for predictions.
- **`models/`**: Includes the trained machine learning model.
  - `model.pkl`: The trained model file.
- **`templates/`**: Holds the HTML files used in the Flask web application.
  - `index.html`: The main HTML template for the web interface.
- **`static/images/`**: Contains images used in the web interface.
  - `book.jpg`, `c1.jpg`, `c2.jpg`, `pic.jpg`: Images used in the web interface.
- **`Algorithms.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the core project code and analysis.
- **`app.py`**: The Flask application script that runs the web interface for fare predictions.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies required to run the project.
- **`README.md`**: Project overview and instructions (this file).
- **`LICENSE`**: The project license.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes algorithms to predict Uber fares based on historical data.
- **Flask Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with Flask to input ride details and receive fare predictions.
- **Data-Driven Approach**: The model is trained on a real-world dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Well-Organized Structure**: The project is neatly organized into directories, making it easy to navigate and understand.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VangaLasyaSri/Uber_Car_Fare_Prediction.git
    ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**: Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Flask Application**: Start the Flask app to interact with the model through a web interface:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. **Access the Web Interface**: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the fare prediction tool.
